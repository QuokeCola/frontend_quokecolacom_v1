# Adaptive CoreXY 4Z Moving Platform

This 4Z moving platform is intended to be used for a cell incubator. With E3D's tool changer installed, it could be 
easily adapted into a 3D printer.

## Highlight

The design is adaptive, while it allows people to modify the size of the platform by simply change the length of rail.

As a moving platform it could also be applied as a laser cutting or CNC machine for soft materials (Like plastic).

The X carriage used is the tool changer system on E3D, so it can easily be modified as one 3D printer.

As the tool head could move along Z axis, more tools could be mounted on this mounting panel.
