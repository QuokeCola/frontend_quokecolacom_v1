# Extruder for 3D printer

This extruder was inspired by Voron2.4 Afterburner X Carriage. Instead of using 3D printer parts, the extruder
mainly consists of Carbon fiber panels or panels using other material, so it could be easily CNC machined or laser cut.
The gears and bearings are identical with those on Titan Extruder, so you can easily modify the that extruder into this one.
