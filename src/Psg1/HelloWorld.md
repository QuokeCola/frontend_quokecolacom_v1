# Hello world!  

Nice to meet you! This is my first post of this blog. Thanks for visiting my website!
In the future I will post more interesting things about what I am doing on here.

## Markdown Renderer
[marked.js](https://marked.js.org) and [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org) was integrated in this website, while it 
provide perfect render effects, including code highlights.
Here are some examples.
### Python
```python
print("Hello world!")
```

### C++
```cpp
cout << "hello world";
class hello {
    static char[] world;
}
```
